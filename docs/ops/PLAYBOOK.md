# PLAYBOOK.md — The Phase Sequence (T+0 → T+48)

**THIS EVENT: gate times = VC-BRAIN-PLAN §0.5 build order (feature freeze 03:00 ET, video by 05:30, submit 06:30, deadline 09:00 ET Jul 19); the phases below are the generic 48h template — scale accordingly.**

Scale proportionally for shorter events. Gates are HARD: when a gate time arrives, its overrun rule beats whatever is in progress. Claude checks the current phase before every work block.

## Phase 0 — Hour-0 Setup (T+0 → T+0.5 · 30 min cap)
- Clone template outside sync folders · `.gitignore` verified · first push · remote reachable.
- Fill `docs/ops/RUBRIC.md` (track sentences verbatim, weights, judges, submission requirements).
- Open the submission portal draft if it exists.
- **Exit:** clean `git status`, pushed, rubric filled. **Overrun:** you're over-engineering setup — push and move.

## Phase 1 — Front-Loaded Exploration (T+0.5 → T+5 · 4.5h box)
Run in parallel; each spike produces a written artifact in `docs/ops/PREFLIGHT.md`:
1. **Idea scoring (45 min):** weighted rubric scoring of candidates (the 6-factor method worked — keep it). Score → pick → STOP scoring forever. *(Last time scoring re-ran into day 2.)*
2. **Tool viability spikes (90 min):** for every external tool/API, prove the exact write you depend on with a real call; document the can't-do list.
3. **Deploy smoke (45 min):** hello-world on the real host; hit it from the real frontend origin; verify CORS, favicon, env vars.
4. **Data fixture + invariant (30 min):** write the core invariant test, then the fixture, then run it.
5. **Auth spike (30 min):** prove the token/scope path with one live call.

**The human's Phase-1 job — the mentor circuit:** the spikes run without you. Spend that time on the floor: sponsor workshops and mentors leak what the judges reward (they often ARE the judges). Ask sponsors "what do you wish existed on your platform?" and log every quote into docs/ops/RUBRIC.md §5 — it's free rubric intel no repo can give you, and judge warmth at Q&A time is built here, not on stage.

**⛔ GATE at T+5 (non-negotiable):** real write ✓ · live page reachable ✓ · fixture invariant ✓ · idea picked ✓. Any red → pick the simpler idea whose unknowns you DID close. Exploration buys certainty, not more options.

## Phase 2 — Spec Lock (T+5 → T+6 · 1h burst)
- Write all specs in one burst with explicit parallel-track role division. *(This produced 8 specs in 20 minutes last time — the single best sequence of the event. Keep it.)*
- Spec header: track sentence verbatim · REAL persona · named wow moment.
- **Exit:** specs pushed · SCOPE FROZEN · submission draft pushed · `docs/ops/DESIGN.md` §2 filled.
- **Overrun:** cut spec detail, never the invariant or the wow moment.

### The spec pipeline that locked team distribution last time (reverse-engineered — reuse it)
Five transformations, each making the previous layer more executable. Different people can own different steps:
1. **Research corpus** (lead + agent): rubric, tool capability truth, scored ideas — the Phase-1 artifacts.
2. **Adversarial masterplan** (one teammate): feed the chosen concept to 2+ EXTERNAL LLMs for critique (Grok + Perplexity worked); extract the CONSENSUS into one doc: honest score /100, top-3 upgrades ranked by rubric-ROI with hour estimates, a unanimous **kill list**, pitch angle. Write it AS A PROMPT for the build agent — amounts locked, file names fixed, explicit "agent executes parts X, humans own parts Y."
3. **Build pack** (lead + agent): consolidate ALL research + the masterplan into one canonical `BUILD.md` + a folder of small typed files (avoids context truncation).
4. **Formal numbered specs** (one teammate + their agent, ~20 min): two waves — WHAT (app overview, backend, API, frontend: 01–04 generated as one batch) then HOW-IN-PARALLEL (implementation plans with explicitly independent tracks: 05–06) then VERIFY (test plans: 07–08). Numbered specs = addressable work units ("implement spec 03 §/approve"), which is what makes distribution enforceable.
5. **Per-person bridges**: `CLAUDE.md` distilled from specs (the agent contract) · a **paste-ready design prompt** for teammates who don't use coding agents (they build in Lovable/v0 from it) · issues/kanban generated from spec docs for assignment.

## Phase 3 — Walking Skeleton (T+6 → T+12 · 6h box)
- Thinnest end-to-end slice of the golden path through the REAL integration.
- **Exit:** one real transaction completes end-to-end (the wow moment works once, for real).
- **Overrun:** stop all feature work; nothing matters until this is green.

## Phase 4 — Thickening (T+12 → T+30 · 18h)
- Features on the proven spine. Tests in the same commit. Frontend golden-path screens to FINISHED (loading/empty/error) before any new surface.
- **Checkpoints T+16 / T+22 / T+28:** live smoke (real read + one real write) · artifact-hygiene sweep (`git status` junk-free, demo data regenerated) · push · `TODO.md` updated.
- **Overrun:** drop the lowest-rubric-value feature, never a checkpoint.

## Phase 5 — Feature Freeze + Demo (T+30 → T+42 · 12h)
- Full rehearsal on the DEPLOYED url with a fresh browser.
- **RECORD THE DEMO VIDEO NOW (by T+36 at the latest).** A rough recorded demo beats a perfect unrecorded one. Re-record only if it improves. *(Last time: 1 hour left → rushed video.)*
- Regenerate all demo artifacts via the reset script. Commit screenshots. Rehearse the 3-minute pitch out loud twice against `docs/ops/PITCH.md`.
- **Exit:** video uploaded + linked · screenshots pushed · pitch rehearsed · deployed URL exercised end-to-end.

## Phase 6 — Frozen Submission Runway (T+42 → T+48 · code-frozen)
- No code merges. Submission copy finalized; **commit AND push after every single edit.**
- Verify every submitted link in an incognito browser.
- **Exit:** form submitted EARLY · `git status` clean · pushed HEAD == submitted claims.

## Standing rules (every phase)
- Commit before risk (parallel agents, network windows, refactors).
- Push == done.
- One golden path; ideas post-lock → `docs/ops/BACKLOG.md` + displacement test.
- Multi-agent only for genuinely separable work; solo on the golden-path spine.
- Human reads `TODO.md`; agent updates it at every boundary.
